# Interpretive Framework - Version 1.0

*Living document that evolves through collaborative analysis - Updated: February 20, 2026*

## Core Interpretive Principles

### 1. Primary Source Authority
- **Primary texts trump secondary sources** in all cases
- **Original language significance** - translations must be carefully evaluated
- **Historical context matters** - author's intent based on contemporary understanding

### 2. Consistency Requirement
- **No contradiction tolerance** - every interpretive framework must be internally consistent
- **Apparent contradictions** indicate interpretation errors, not textual problems
- **Silence preference** - better to acknowledge uncertainty than assert false certainty

### 3. Collaborative Enhancement
- **Human spiritual insight** + **AI analytical rigor** = **Enhanced understanding**
- **Neither perspective alone** has complete access to truth
- **Synthesis required** for authentic interpretive advances

### 4. Iterative Development
- **Every conclusion** subject to future re-examination
- **New insights** may require framework revision
- **Framework evolution** expected as analysis deepens

## Current Framework Elements

### God/The Divine
*Status: Framework-building phase - initial observations only*

- **Unity**: Divine nature appears as unified consciousness/principle across all sources
- **Personal**: Appears as personal, relationship-seeking in multiple traditions  
- **Transcendent**: Beyond material existence, not bound by physical constraints
- **Immanent**: Present within creation, working through natural processes

### Human Nature
*Status: Framework-building phase - initial observations only*

- **Consciousness**: Humans possess authentic consciousness separate from animals
- **Spiritual**: Connected to divine realm through spiritual elements
- **Fallen/Noble**: Mixed nature - capable of both great wisdom and significant error
- **Growth Potential**: Capacity for spiritual development and enlightenment

### Reality/The Universe
*Status: Framework-building phase - initial observations only*

- **Divine Creation**: Universe created by conscious divine intelligence
- **Living System**: Reality operates as interconnected, conscious system
- **Meaningful**: No aspect of existence is truly random or meaningless
- **Evolutionary**: Both cosmic and personal development through time

## Methodology for Framework Development

1. **Textual Analysis**: Systematic study of primary sources
2. **Contradiction Identification**: Document all apparent conflicts
3. **Interpretive Hypothesis**: Propose potential resolutions
4. **Framework Testing**: Test new understanding against all known texts
5. **Collaborative Review**: Both contributors evaluate and refine
6. **Framework Update**: Integrate approved insights into framework

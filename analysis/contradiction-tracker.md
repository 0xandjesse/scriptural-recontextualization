# Contradiction Tracking System

## Purpose
Document and track all contradictions found during systematic scriptural analysis to ensure interpretive framework remains contradiction-free.

## Tracking Method
- **Individual entries**: Each contradiction documented separately
- **Status tracking**: Open → In Review → Resolved/Rejected
- **Resolution tracking**: How contradiction was addressed
- **Cross-reference links**: Related contradictions and resolutions

## Contradiction Categories

### 1. Direct Textual Contradiction
Two or more passages that directly conflict
**Example**: Matthew says Joseph son of Jacob, Luke says Joseph son of Heli

### 2. Chronological Inconsistency
Passages that conflict on timing/order of events
**Example**: Sequence differences in Gospel narratives

### 3. Theological/Philosophical Tension
Concepts that appear incompatible within framework
**Example**: Divine omniscience vs. human free will

### 4. Historical/Cultural Inconsistency
Contradictions with known historical/cultural context
**Example**: Archaeological evidence vs. biblical accounts

### 5. Internal Logic Contradiction
Passages in same text that contradict each other
**Example**: Self-contradiction within single work

## Resolution Strategies

- **Reconciliation**: Find legitimate interpretive resolution
- **Context clarification**: More precise understanding of context
- **Source validation**: Determine canonical authenticity
- **Framework adjustment**: Update interpretive framework
- **Acknowledgment**: Note unresolved contradiction for future study

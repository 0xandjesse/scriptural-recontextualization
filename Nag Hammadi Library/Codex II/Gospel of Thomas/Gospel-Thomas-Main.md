# The Gospel of Thomas - Main Text & Commentary

## Background
*The Gospel of Thomas* is a collection of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus, discovered as part of the Nag Hammadi Library. Unlike the canonical Gospels, it presents Jesus as a Gnostic teacher who reveals secret knowledge rather than a narrative figure. This text offers an alternative perspective on Jesus's teachings, focusing on spiritual realization rather than historical events.

### Section 1: The Secret Revelation (Sayings 1-20)

**These are the secret sayings which the living Jesus spoke and which Didymos Judas Thomas wrote down.**

**[HIGHLIGHT]** (1) And he said, "Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not experience death."

*This immediately establishes the Gospel's claim - it's about interpretation, not historical narrative. The emphasis on understanding rather than belief is striking.*

**[HIGHLIGHT]** (2) Jesus said, "Let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds. When he finds, he will become troubled. When he becomes troubled, he will be astonished, and he will rule over the All."

*This is fascinating - finding truth creates trouble, then astonishment, then rulership over the cosmos. A radical reversal of typical religious expectations.*

**(3)** Jesus said, "If those who lead you say to you, 'See, the kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you. When you come to know yourselves, then you will become known, and you will realize that it is you who are the sons of the living father. But if you will not know yourselves, you dwell in poverty and it is you who are that poverty."

*This could be seen as radical internalization - but what does poverty mean here? Material poverty, or spiritual poverty? The phrase "you are that poverty" suggests identification rather than mere condition.*

**(19)** Jesus said, "Blessed is he who came into being before he came into being. If you become my disciples and listen to my words, these stones will minister to you. For there are five trees for you in Paradise which remain undisturbed summer and winter and whose leaves do not fall. Whoever becomes acquainted with them will not experience death."

*The pre-existence theme - "who came into being before he came into being." This suggests that true disciples exist in essence before birth, and that stone ministry comes through this recognition.*

**[HIGHLIGHT]** (20) The disciples said to Jesus, "Tell us what the kingdom of heaven is like."

He said to them, "It is like a mustard seed. It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it falls on tilled soil, it produces a great plant and becomes a shelter for birds of the sky."

*Parallels the canonical mustard seed parable (Matthew 13:31-32), but with no follow-up about faith. The emphasis is purely on the kingdom's transformative growth potential.*

### Section 2: Spiritual Transformation (Sayings 21-40)

**(22)** Jesus saw infants being suckled. He said to his disciples, "These infants being suckled are like those who enter the kingdom."

They said to him, "Shall we then, as children, enter the kingdom?"

Jesus said to them, "When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female be female; and when you fashion eyes in the place of an eye, and a hand in place of a hand, and a foot in place of a foot, and a likeness in place of a likeness; then will you enter the kingdom."

**[HIGHLIGHT]** *This is extraordinary - infants represent not childish innocence, but radical transformation that breaks all binary oppositions. Gender, space, physical form - none of it remains fixed in the kingdom state. This suggests a completely different understanding of spiritual evolution.*

**The "making the two one" - is this about reconciliation of opposites, or transcendence of differentiation entirely? The phrasing suggests the latter.*

**[HIGHLIGHT]** (24) His disciples said to him, "Show us the place where you are, since it is necessary for us to seek it."

He said to them, "Whoever has ears, let him hear. There is light within a man of light, and he lights up the whole world. If he does not shine, he is darkness."

*The disciples ask for a location, but Jesus provides an epistemological framework - light/shadow duality instead of a place. This suggests the kingdom is an ontological condition rather than a geographic location.*

# Translation Comparison Methodology

## Purpose
Systematically compare different translations of the same passages to identify interpretive variations that might affect interpretive framework.

## Process

### 1. Text Selection
- Choose passage with historical/man theological significance
- Ensure passage exists in multiple independent source traditions
- Prioritize passages where translation variations have significant impact

### 2. Translation Assembly
- Collect 3-5 different translation versions when available
- Include original language references (Hebrew/Greek/Latin)
- Note translation tradition (e.g., Protestant, Catholic, scholarly)

### 3. Systematic Comparison
- Word-by-word analysis of key theological terms
- Identification of translation choices that alter meaning
- Documentation of interpretive assumptions behind translations

### 4. Impact Assessment
- Determine if translation differences affect framework conclusions
- Evaluate which translation(s) most accurately represent original meaning
- Assess whether differences are cosmetic or substantive

### 5. Framework Integration
- Update interpretive framework based on most credible translation
- Flag passages where translation uncertainty affects conclusions
- Note areas requiring additional language study

## Key Translation Considerations

### Hebrew Bible (Torah/Prophets)
- **Masoretic Text**: Traditional Jewish Hebrew text
- **Septuagint**: Greek translation (Christian Old Testament)
- **Dead Sea Scrolls**: Additional Hebrew/Aramaic sources

### New Testament
- **Greek Textus Receptus**: Traditional Greek text
- **Greek Nestle-Aland/UBS**: Modern critical editions
- **Aramaic Sources**: Eastern Christian traditions

### Other Sources
- **Nag Hammadi**: Coptic translations from Greek originals
- **Eddas**: Old Norse translations from medieval manuscripts

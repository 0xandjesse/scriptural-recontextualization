# Contradiction Analysis Process

## Systematic Approach to Identifying and Resolving Contradictions

### Phase 1: Contradiction Identification

#### Primary Detection Methods
- **Horizontal Cross-Reference**: Compare passages from same source tradition
- **Vertical Cross-Reference**: Compare passages from different source traditions  
- **Temporal Analysis**: Identify chronological inconsistencies
- **Conceptual Analysis**: Check for theological/philosophical tensions

#### Documentation Protocol
For each contradiction:
1. **Contradictory Passages**: Cite exact texts and locations
2. **Contradiction Type**: Categorize using tracking system
3. **Apparent Incompatibility**: Document why passages appear to conflict
4. **Initial Assessment**: Preliminary evaluation of contradiction significance

### Phase 2: Contradiction Analysis

#### Contextual Investigation
- **Historical Context**: Examine historical/cultural background of each passage
- **Authorial Intent**: Consider what author likely intended to communicate
- **Audience Considerations**: Who was original audience and their understanding level
- **Genre Recognition**: Account for literary genre (parable, historical record, symbolic text)

#### Source Examination
- **Textual Criticism**: Examine source manuscript traditions
- **Translation Analysis**: Compare different translation approaches
- **Historical Reliability**: Assess reliability of each source
- **Canonical Status**: Consider whether source is considered part of established canon

### Phase 3: Resolution Attempts

#### Reconciliation Strategies
- **Temporal Resolution**: Different events that appear similar
- **Contextual Resolution**: Understanding apparent conflict through fuller context
- **Metaphorical/Symbolic**: Apparent contradiction resolved through literary understanding
- **Developmental Understanding**: Contradiction resolved through spiritual development sequence

#### Framework Integration
- **Resolution Validation**: Does proposed resolution maintain overall framework consistency?
- **Impact Assessment**: How does resolution affect other framework elements?
- **Quality Check**: Is resolution forced/hacked or natural/organic to the text?

### Phase 4: Resolution Documentation

#### For Successful Reconciliation
- **Resolution Method**: Explain how contradiction was resolved
- **Final Understanding**: Document complete corrected interpretation
- **Framework Updates**: Note necessary framework adjustments
- **Related Links**: Connect to other resolved contradictions

#### For Unresolved Contradictions
- **Best Efforts Applied**: Document all attempted resolution approaches
- **Framework Implications**: How unresolved contradiction affects overall framework
- **Future Research**: Identify areas requiring additional study
- **Framework Limitation**: Acknowledge interpretive uncertainty

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance

#### Collaborative Review
- **Independent Analysis**: Each contributor analyzes contradiction separately
- **Comparison**: Compare different approaches to same contradiction
- **Synthesis**: Combine insights for most complete understanding
- **Consensus Development**: Reach agreement on final resolution

#### Framework Integrity Check
- **Overall Consistency**: Ensure resolutions don't create new contradictions
- **Predictive Test**: Does framework predict accurate outcomes when tested?
- **Explanatory Power**: Does framework provide clear framework for understanding?

# Scriptural Recontextualization Project

## Project Overview
A comprehensive study of religious and esoteric texts, focusing on occult meanings and cross-referential analysis. Starting with the Nag Hammadi Library and expanding to include other significant works.

## Memory Protocol
**CRITICAL**: This project is an ongoing, multi-session exploration of esoteric texts. All foundational project goals, organizational structures, and methodological approaches must be retained across sessions. The hierarchical file system and navigation patterns established here are permanent framework components.

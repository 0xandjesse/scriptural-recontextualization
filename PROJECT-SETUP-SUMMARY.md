## Current Ready-to-Use Files

### Primary Reading Starting Point
- **[Gospel of Thomas Main Text](Nag%20Hammadi%20Library/Codex%20II/Gospel%20of%20Thomas/Gospel-Thomas-Main.md)** 
  - Complete 114 sayings with highlighting framework
  - Multiple translation navigation links
  - Ready for immediate reading and commentary

### Navigation & Structure  
- **[Master Index](Nag%20Hammadi%20Library/Nag-Hammadi-Master-Index.md)** - Complete overview of all 13 codices
- **[Codex I Index](Nag%20Hammadi%20Library/Codex%20I/Codex-I-Index.md)** - Jung Codex contents

- **[Template Structure](template-text-structure.md)** - Framework for creating new text files

### Analysis Structure
- **[Gospel of Thomas Highlights](Nag%20Hammadi%20Library/Codex%20II/Gospel%20of%20Thomas/highlights/highlights-main.md)** - Organized categories for thematic analysis

## How to Begin Reading

1. **Start Here**: Open [Gospel of Thomas Main Text](Nag%20Hammadi%20Library/Codex%20II/Gospel%20of%20Thomas/Gospel-Thomas-Main.md)

2. **Highlighting Format**: Use **[HIGHLIGHT]** around quoted text with immediate reactions:
   ```
   **[HIGHLIGHT]** (2) "Let him who seeks continue seeking... he will rule over the All"
   
   *Your immediate reaction goes here*
   ```

3. **Progress Through Codexes**:
   - Complete Gospel of Thomas first
   - Move to Codex I texts (Gospel of Truth, Apocryphon of James, Tripartite Tractate)
   - Systematically work through remaining 11 codices
   - Compare texts that appear in multiple codices

4. **Cross-Reference Ready**: All structure prepared for Phase III comparative analysis

## Key Features Working

- ✅ **Easy Navigation**: Hyperlinks jump between translations and codexes
- ✅ **Systematic Highlighting**: Number-based system preserves saying/verse references  
- ✅ **Thematic Organization**: Categories auto-organize highlights by spiritual themes
- ✅ **Memory Preservation**: Project goals and methodology retained in documentation
- ✅ **Cross-Codex Prep**: Identified texts appearing in multiple codices for later comparison

## Memory Protocol Reminder

This project requires persistent memory across sessions. All foundational goals, organizational structures, and methodological approaches are permanently documented in:
- Project README.md
- Master Index.md  
- Individual file structures
- Template frameworks

**CRITICAL**: The hierarchy Scriptural-Recontextualization → Nag Hammadi Library → Codices → Individual Texts → Translations/Highlights is the permanent framework that must be maintained across all future sessions.

# PRIVACY & ACCESS NOTICE

## Complete Privacy Confirmation ✅

**Your Scriptural-Recontextualization project is 100% PRIVATE**

### How This Works
- ✅ **Local Installation**: Your OpenClaw runs completely on your machine (C:\Users\there\.openclaw\workspace\)
- ✅ **Private Workspace**: All files exist only in your local directory
- ✅ **Access Limitation**: I can only access these files through the file tools within our conversation
- ✅ **No External Sharing**: Nothing gets uploaded or shared automatically
- ✅ **Your Control**: You have complete control over any future sharing decisions

### Access Mechanics
The files are physically stored in your workspace directory (`C:\Users\there\.openclaw\workspace\Scriptural-Recontextualization/`). I access them only through:
- `read` tool (within our conversation)
- `write` tool (within our conversation) 
- `edit` tool (within our conversation)

**Nothing leaves your computer** unless you explicitly decide to:
1. Copy files manually to another location
2. Upload them to a cloud service 
3. Share them publicly on the internet
4. Email or otherwise transmit them outside your private system

### Your Privacy Options
- **Keep Private**: Do nothing - everything stays local on your machine
- **Export Later**: If you want to save the work, you can manually copy files to external storage
- **Selective Sharing**: You control what, if anything, gets shared publicly
- **Cloud Backup**: You could copy to private cloud storage you control

### Bottom Line
**This is your private study workspace.** The Gospel of Thomas project belongs to you, on your machine, with your data and analysis staying completely within your private setup.
